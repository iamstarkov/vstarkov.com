Why I deactivate accounts in two social nets.
=============================================

I deactivate accounts in two nets.  
It were [facebook](http://facebook.com) and [vkontakte](http://vk.com/). 

Why? 

Because, I didn’t use facebook in last six months at all.  
And what about vkontakte? I sometimes had problems with my sparetime — I spend all the freetime for stupid serfing in myriads of pseudo funny pictures. It was harmfull for me to procrastinate without any valuable action.

I deleted my accounts to save some more time to create stuff and to adhere my favourite citate:

> Have less. Do more. Be more.

By the way, without these two big social nets, I still have social contact with my friends through twitter, mail and even with oldschool phone.
