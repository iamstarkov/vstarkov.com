Printer-friendly versions of specifications
================================================================================

Once I wanted to have a printed version of the specification to read them when I have free time. After it I explored [webmasters.stackexchange][1] and found question about [web specifications][2]

After it I found links on [CSS 2.1][3], [HTML 4][4] and [HTML5 w3][5] and [HTML 5 WHATWG][6] specifications and that each of stable specs (CSS 2.1 and HTML 4) has several printable versions of itself. For example CSS 2.1 see at the bottom of picture  
![enter image description here][7]

## The list of printable versions of specifications
* [CSS 2.1 plain text][8]
* [CSS 2.1 pdf][9]
* [HTML 4.01 plain text][10]
* [HTML 4.01 gzipped pdf][11]
* [HTML 5 WHATWG single-page][12]
* [HTML 5 W3.org single page][13]
* [HTML 5 WHATWG (converted to pdf and downloaded to google drive)][14]
* [HTML 5 W3.org (converted to pdf and downloaded to google drive)][15]
