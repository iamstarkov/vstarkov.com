Why you should read more than one (technical) book a month
============================================================

Considering the number of books I read last year, I was a bit discouraged - they turned out just eleven (only six of them are technical). I think that is very little.

Then my colleague [Ilya][1] said that he has nearly 20 books in his "to read" list.This made me think that if I would have the same list, I could read it in two years. And this is a small collection of books in essence. Moreover, half of the books even from such small list is likely to become obsolete during these two years. This effect is unpleasant because of a shortfall of the required at that moment knowledge. Next unpleasant thing is that ten books a year may not be enough for a decent development of you as an expert. If we will add to "to read" list all useful books about your programming language, plus interesting and possibly useful books about neighboring languages and subject areas (e.g. regular expressions), plus reviews on different popular frameworks, also if we will add books required for self-development more than as frontend-developer (e.g fundamentals of management, planning time or design) â€” the list of required books increases to unimaginable limits. Now it is not clear to me how to deal with so many books, reading one a month.

So I decided to start small, but not simple solution - I will try to read at least two (technical) books a month.

PS. However, still convinced that we should not even look at the book that can't at least try in practice, since with this approach all of the information from this book will be lost without a trace, so reading this book is just a waste of time.
