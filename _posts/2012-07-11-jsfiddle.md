Today I want to tell you about popular tool for demonstration your web examples — [jsFiddle][9]. For example, it very usefull to use it on sites, like [Stackoverflow][2]. I often use this site to create a highly specialized for a demo bugs (testcase). Also it is very appropriate to be used for the project [Highcharts] [3] as a visual demonstration [various] [4] [options] [5].

## How To

In the main window there are three input-areas (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and the one area to display the results.  
In the top sidebar there are two main buttons ‘Run’ и ‘Save’. ‘Run’ button force result area to refresh. ‘Save’ button increment fiddle's version numner, save fiddle and force result area to refresh.

### Personal review
I advise everyone to learn how to use this wonderful resource, and to share your mini works with this project. It seems to me that this is the best project for this purpose.
